# 'Hi, what do jou know about Wikipedia?\n\n
# Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit. 
# It was founded in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Wikipedia is written in the English language 
# and is available in many languages, including Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, 
# Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Vietnamese. 
# There are currently more than 1.2 million articles on Wikipedia. The articles are written 
# by volunteer editors, who are not paid for their work. Anyone with an Internet connection 
# and a computer can contribute to Wikipedia by editing the articles, which are then reviewed 
# by other editors before being added to the main article. Articles can be edited by anyone, 
# but only registered users are allowed to make changes to articles that have been created 
# by a registered user. If you want to edit an article, you will need to register with the 
# site and create an account. You can then edit any article that you have access to.'
